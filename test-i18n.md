# Test Results for i18n Language Switching

## ‚úÖ FIXES IMPLEMENTED

1. **LanguageDetector Component**:
   - Added proper async language changing with promises
   - Added debugging console logs to track language changes
   - Improved state management with initialization tracking
   - Fixed race conditions between URL changes and i18n updates

2. **Navbar LanguageSwitcher**:
   - Fixed race condition by setting cookies/localStorage BEFORE changing language
   - Added proper error handling
   - Increased delay from 100ms to 150ms for better synchronization
   - Added console debugging to track the language change process
   - Added locale comparison to avoid unnecessary changes

3. **i18n Configuration**:
   - Enabled debug mode in development for better troubleshooting
   - Added proper React i18n bindings for language change events
   - Improved React configuration for better component updates

4. **Navbar Component**:
   - Added language change listener to force component re-renders
   - Added languageKey state to trigger useMemo recalculation
   - Improved translation dependency management

## üîç WHAT WAS FIXED

The main issues were:
1. **Race Conditions**: Language change was happening after navigation, causing inconsistent states
2. **Component Updates**: Components weren't re-rendering when language changed
3. **Timing Issues**: Insufficient delays between language change and navigation
4. **State Management**: Poor synchronization between URL locale and i18n state

## üìä TEST RESULTS

From the server logs, we can see:
- ‚úÖ Language changes are working (`i18next: languageChanged pt-BR`)
- ‚úÖ Navigation to different locales is successful (`/en-US`, `/es-ES`, `/pt-BR`)
- ‚úÖ Translation loading is working properly
- ‚úÖ i18n system initialization is successful

## üéØ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

Now when users:
1. Click on language switcher in navbar
2. Select a different language
3. The page should navigate to the new locale URL
4. All translated text should update immediately
5. The language preference should be saved in localStorage and cookies

## üîß DEBUG MODE

Debug mode is enabled in development, so you can see detailed logs in the browser console when changing languages.

To test:
1. Open http://localhost:3002
2. Open browser developer tools (Console tab)
3. Click on the language switcher in the navbar
4. Select a different language
5. Watch the console logs and see the page content update
